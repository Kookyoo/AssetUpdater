# AssetUpdater
Simple asset updater project.

It's a Unity3d Editor Window tool aimed to allow the user to select any prefab in a project database containing a specific component. The feature is present in the hierarchy window but cannot be applied as a filter in project window, so I created that small tool both as a real use case and a tutorial to create an Editor Window.

Feel free to use, modify and share it :)
